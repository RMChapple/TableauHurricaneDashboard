## How to build 'The Hurricane Dashboard' in Tableau

As part of my company's Learn Day initiative, I'm giving a 'how to' tutorial on building a visualisation of the NOAA HURDAT2 datasource in Tableau. In other words, I'm demoing 'The Hurricane Dashboard'.

Why this particular dashboard? Well ... the building process showcases a nice range of beginner and intermediate techniques, but mostly it is relatively quick to make and delivers spectacular results! What's not to like?
